You can use highlighting tools to mark code with different colors like taking notes to
distinguish code.

- I used Emacs package [[https://github.com/wolray/symbol-overlay/][symbol-overlay]] or other similar highlighting packages.

** Jump to definition of any code

There are some options to select:

- Use text searching tools directly, Emacs =isearch=, =grep=, =ag=, =pt=, =rg= etc.
- If you want advanced text searching, can use "=regexp= search", Emacs has built-in
  support, and has some packages to help you, even can use PCRE (Perl regexp) in Emacs
  with package "=pcre2el=".
- In current buffer, you can use =Imenu=, etc to jump.
- Or even open an class/functions definitions sidebar to have an overview of your code.

** Jump to definition of thing-at-point
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       3879abc2-861c-407e-9cab-bd08ed1fe9cd
:END:

When code definition is not in the same window page area, you want to jump to definition.
You can use =xref.el= (which is Emacs built-in support now). If you want to keep current
code viewing, you can create a function to accept universal prefix argument
 for =[M-.]= to open code definition in other window. If you don't
want to mess your windows up, you also can try Emacs new feature (from 26?) "child-frame".
There is an existing package called "[[https://github.com/tumashu/posframe][posframe]]" can be helpful.


* Figure out of Code by running it

Sometimes I can't understand the code by reading, then I try to run code with debugger/tracer.

For example, Elisp code, Emacs has built-in tool =Edebug=.

Because Edebug show stop point result in echo-area (minibuffer). It is not convinient for
me. I want it displayed at point.

[[file:data/6c/961996-eff9-41fa-a420-9272520996af/Edebug result at point.png]]

Here is my trick after I dive into Edebug source code:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my:edebug-previous-result ()
    "Print the previous result."
    (interactive)
    ;; (pos-tip-show edebug-previous-result 'popup-face) ; slow
    (popup-tip edebug-previous-result :truncate t :height 20 :width 45 :nostrip t :margin 1 :nowait nil)
    )
  (advice-add 'edebug-previous-result :override #'my:edebug-previous-result)
#+end_src

*Tip*: Sometimes edebug will auto scroll down, when stop point moves to bottom of window,
 the result popup is truncated, you can use  (~recenter-top-bottom~)
 to recenter window. Then redisplay result popup with =[r]=.

About other programming languages, like C, C++, there are tools for static diagnostic as
[[https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls/wiki/Emacs][@MaskRay wiki mentioned]], and dynamic diagnostic like [[http://cgdb.github.io/][cgdb]] ([[https://emacs-china.org/t/topic/5855/27][@MaskRay mentioned]]).

More programming languages has more relative tools. I will not list them one by one at
here. Just give out some examples that wish can inspire you. That's all.

* TODO Will add more tricks here in future
